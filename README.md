## Disputes between Pearl and Rubin
 Not necessarily books. Posts and papers are included.

* <font size=3>**Resolving disputes between J. Pearl and D. Rubin on causal inference**</font> [[**Go to post**]](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2009/07/05/disputes_about/)   
  <font size=3><font color=#008000>**[Must Read]**</font> The post from Prof. Gelman shows the disputes from Rubin's perspective. It helps understand why Pearl's framework faces great challenges in the statistic community while being so successful in machine learning and social computing. </font>

### From Judea Pearl (Prof. at UCLA)

* <font size=3>**Chapter 8, The Book of Why?**</font> [[**Get book**]](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=bAipNH8AAAAJ&citation_for_view=bAipNH8AAAAJ:EsrhoZGmrkoC)   
  <font size=3><font color=#008000>**[Must Read]**</font> Pearl's overall discussion of the short comings of Rubin's potential outcome framework. </font>

* <font size=3>**Can causal inference be done in statistical vocabulary?**</font> [[**Go to post**]](http://causality.cs.ucla.edu/blog/index.php/2019/01/09/can-causal-inference-be-done-in-statistical-vocabulary/)   
  <font size=3><font color=#008000>**[Must Read]**</font> Pearl's initial reponse to Gelman's critics on The book of why. </font>

* <font size=3>**More on Gelman’s views of causal inference**</font> [[**Go to post**]](http://causality.cs.ucla.edu/blog/index.php/2019/01/15/more-on-gelmans-views-of-causal-inference/)
